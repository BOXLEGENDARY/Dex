## Warning
`If you can't use the menu function in explorer, it means your executor (tools) are not supported, or the function is locked by itself.`

## Log
the console will be removed soon since it’s basically useless and just causes lag. we all know what Dex is for anyway. if you really need it, just type /console in chat—that’s it.

## Loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/BOXLEGENDARY/Dex/releases/latest/download/out.lua"))()
```

---

## To Build
1. Download this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3 (I use 3.9.0)
3. Run build.py
4. The executable script will be created as out.lua
